Adds a collection of roles by LinearPoint to the game Demon Bluff by UmiArt.
The roles are based around the central mechanic of Madness, loosely based on the similarly named mechanic from the social deduction game Blood on the Clocktower. They might be lying about who they are but are trying their best to help.

The new roles will show up in the Endless Mode for the game

**Important** In order to add art you will need to have the AreSwap mod by ITR13 and add the "[role]_MaHy" folders into the ArtSwap folder. Replace the [role] part with whatever the role's name is.
Note that the art is currently unfinished, so you may want to find other art in the community that you think fits.

#### New Mechanic: Madness
**Disclaimer:** Madness is an advanced mechanic that may take several games to grasp the nuances of. Despite the difficulty, the puzzles generated with madness are intended to be solvable, and feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Mad characters will disguise as either a villager or outcast. The exact disguising rules are up to the character that is creating the madness. Read carefully the modded cards you come across to avoid getting tripped up. Unless otherwise stated, there is a 60% chance that a good aligned mad character will lie, however, if they are evil or corrupted the mad character will always lie. Mad characters can never use the mechanical effect of the character they are mad as (such as Slayer, Alchemist, or Baker). Characters that are mad and do have a mechanical effect will still have their normal effects happen even if mad as something else (such as a mad Knight cannot die, and a mad Alchemist will still cure people).

#### New Roles
<ul>
<li>***Actor (Villager)*** - Pick someone who is alive and become mad as the character they are claiming to be. Might still lie due to madness, but will copy the target's abilities even if the target is lying.</li>
<li>***Empath (Villager)*** - Learns the true role of the closest disguised character to them, but not what they are disguised as.</li>
<li>***Tax Collector (Villager)*** - Learns one character that is not in play. They are always fooled into thinking the Demon's chosen bluff is in play.</li>
<li>***Magician (Outcast)*** - Picks a townsfolk to their left and right and makes both of them mad as the other's character. To compensate they learn a character who is mad. However, if there is not a villager on either of their sides they will instead become corrupted.</li>
<li>***Pixie (Outcast)*** - Adds a fake minion to the deck view and uses the abilities of the fake minion added.</li>
<li>***Siren (Minion)*** - Makes one of their good neighbors mad using minion disguising rules.</li>
<li>***Cakler (Demon)*** - The Cakler and all outcasts become mad as in-play villagers. Be careful; unlike other demons, the Cakler tries to get into double claims to seem like they are an outcast.</li>
</ul>
