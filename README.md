# LinearExpansionPack
Adds a collection of roles by LinearPoint to the game Demon Bluff by UmiArt

The new roles will show up in the Endless Mode for the game

**Important** In order to add art you will need to have the AreSwap mod by ITR13 and add the "[role]_LP" folders into the ArtSwap folder. Replace the [role] part with whatever the role's name is.

#### Roles
<ul>
<li>***Empath (Villager)*** - Learns the true role of the closest Disguised character to them, but not what they are Disguised as.</li>
<li>***Tax Collector (Villager)*** - Learns one character that is not in play. They are always fooled into thinking the Demon's chosen bluff is in play.</li>
<li>***Pixie (Outcast)*** - Adds a fake minion to the Deck View and uses the abilities of the fake minion added.</li>
<li>***Siren (Minion)*** - Makes one of their Good neighbors Mad.</li>
</ul>

#### New Mechanic: Madness
Mad characters will Disguise as a Villager or Outcast. The character they Disguise as may or may not be in play. There is a 60% chance that the Mad character will Lie, the other 40% they will give true information. Mad characters can never use the mechanical effect of the character they are mad as (such as Slayer, Alchemist, or Baker). Characters which are mad and do have a mechanical effect will still have their normal effects happen even if mad as something else (such as a mad Knight cannot die and a mad Alchemist will still cure people).
